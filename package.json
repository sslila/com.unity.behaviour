    "changelog": "### Added\n- BlackboardVariable support for various Resource types.\n- BlackboardVariables of type UnityEngine.Object can now have an embedded value in their field (previously needed to set it in the GameObject's inspector).\n- Added new behaviors to StartOnEvent node (Default, Restart, Once).  \n- Blackboard assets can now be created through the Project view Create menu.\n- Added serialization/deserializatioon support for graph, blackboard and node values to JSON. Added demonstation sample.\n- Allow using `TooltipAttribute` on BlackboardVariables to display a tooltip.\n- Can now right click on a Blackboard Variable to copy its GUID.\n- Can now right click on a Blackboard Variable to copy its GUID.\n- Inspector will now display an inspection of the behavior graph, when nothing else is being selected.\n- The Story button on the editor toolbar has been removed, and the graph's subgraph representation can now be edited through the Inspector.\n- Transform Blackboard Variable type to the default blackboard options.\n- Can add Blackboard references to graphs.\n- Shared variables that are shared between instances of the same graph.\n- Run Subgraph node combines now two nodes, a static Run Subgraph and the new Run Subgraph Dynamic, which can be used to run graphs dynamically on runtime.\n- Subgraph variables can now be added on the Blackboard.\n- Adds new built-in nodes\n- Transform Blackboard Variable type to the default blackboard options.\n- Can add Blackboard references to graphs.\n- Shared variables that are shared between instances of the same graph.\n- Run Subgraph node combines now two nodes, a static Run Subgraph and the new Run Subgraph Dynamic, which can be used to run graphs dynamically on runtime.\n- Subgraph variables can now be added on the Blackboard.\n\n### Changed\n\n- AppUI dependency updated to 2.0.0-pre.6.\n- Blackboard, Node Wizard and Condition Wizard now use a search window for variables.\n- Removed variable icons.\n- Creation wizards fields will be automatically focused when shown.\n- Replaced icons for behavior graph agent and the graph asset with new designs.\n- Updated node filenames and class names to have appropriate postfixes.\n- Replaced all mouse events & usages to pointer events.\n- Updated MoveToLocation and MoveToTarget logic for slowing down as target reached to use a distance from target instead of Min(Speed, Distance);\n- Updated blackboard variable field assignment to support implicit casting between GameObject and components, components and GameObjects as well as components of different types.\n- Moved existing built-in nodes to package namespace\n- Updated built-in nodes categories\n- Merged Repeat nodes into a single node.\n- Merged Run in Parallel nodes into a single node.\n- Updated all tutorial images to be JPEG intead of PNG for a significant memory saving.\n- Start node repeat field is no longer a link field.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Disabled inspector buttons for editing the definitions of built-in nodes.\n- Inspector showing buttons for editing the definitions of built-in nodes.\n- Fixed custom node definition editing not cleaning up existing properties.\n- Crashes on Domain reload caused by OnAssetsSave().\n- Performance when dragging nodes around a graph.\n- Fixed newly created Conditions not being automatically added to the selected Conditional node.\n- Fixed RepeatWhile node behaving like a do while.\n- Conditions not getting copied properly when a conditional node was duplicated.\n- Fixed navigation nodes sometimes stalling after being called successively.\n- Fixed click events going through to elements underneath search menu items.\n- Sequence insertion indicator didn't render at the correct width when dragging a node on top of a node then moving the mouse ontop of another node.\n- Multiple instances of graphs being kept in memory when processed on save.\n- Fixed pressing delete on an empty graph adding unnecessary command.\n- Inheriting from another Node will correctly display the inherited Blackboard Variables.\n- Fixed Graph Editor title blocking interaction with Open and Debug buttons.\n- Crashes on Domain reload caused by OnAssetsSave().\n- Fixed asset name in graph editor not updating when asset name changed on disc.\n- Fixed newly created Conditions not being automatically added to the selected Conditional node.\n- Fixed RepeatWhile node behaving like a do while.\n- Conditions not getting copied properly when a conditional node was duplicated.\n- Fixed navigation nodes sometimes stalling after being called successively.\n- Fixed click events going through to elements underneath search menu items.\n\n### Known Issues\n- Clearing a node field, saving and reverting the asset in source control does not restore the field value.\n- PlayParticleSystem internal pooling does not support runtime deserialization."
